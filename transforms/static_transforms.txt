Static transforms are invoked though the command-line as follows:

ros2 run tf2_ros  static_transform_publisher x y x roll pitch yaw(rad) child_frame parent_frame


In this excersie we create two static transform and there are totally 3 frames i.e. 1. World frame, 2. Robot1 frame and 3. Robot2 frame

The transform is set from world frame to the robot1 frame using the command:
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 2 1 0 1.57 0 0  world robot_1

Note here 1.57 is the yaw which is represented using radians

The transform of the Robot2 frame with respect to the Robot1 frame is set using the command:
ros2 run tf2_ros static_transform_publisher 1 0 0 0 0 0 robot_1 robot_2

To visualize this we make use of ros visualizer called rviz
ros2 run rviz2 rviz2

Initially the frames will not be visible that is because the map is not configured default, set it the world frame to see the visualization
